##Getting and Cleansing Data Course Project
The documentation below provides details regarding the steps taken to collect and cleanse data 
collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. And R program was then used
to produce 2 tidy data sets that can be used for later analysis. 

This repo contains the following files required for the Course Project:
* CodeBook.md
* run_analysis.R

The program file, run_analysis.R, requires no variables to be set before running. When the program is run,
it will download the source data zipped file to the working directory. Please make sure you are in a working
directory that has at least 500 MB for the downloaded file, the extracted files, and the 2 created tidy 
data sets.

CodeBook.md contains complete details regarding the gathering and cleansing steps and the definitions of the tidy data sets.
